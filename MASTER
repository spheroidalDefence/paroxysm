This is the most stable version of Paroxysm. It is well tested (Well, by
comparison) and usually doesn't have too many game-breaking bugs. If you
want to play the game without dealing with glitches and bugs, use this
branch. If you want new features and don't mind a few (lot of) bugs, try
out the Unstable branch. If you REALLY want to break the game, use the
Broken branch.

(Note that we won't accept bug reports from the broken branch!)
